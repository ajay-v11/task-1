# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete frontend authentication system for the Connectree application within the frontend React application folder. The system will provide user login, admin registration, role-based access control, and global state management using modern React patterns. The frontend will integrate with the existing backend authentication API and provide a seamless user experience with conditional rendering based on user roles. All implementation will be done within the frontend/ directory structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access the main application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root path "/" AND is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the login page
2. WHEN a user enters valid email and password credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and store the JWT token in localStorage
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the main application interface
4. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them directly to the main application interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create the first admin account using a secret password, so that I can initialize the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin registration page THEN the system SHALL provide a form with email, password, firstName, lastName, and secretPassword fields
2. WHEN an admin submits valid credentials with the correct secret password THEN the system SHALL create the admin account
3. WHEN an admin tries to create an account with an incorrect secret password THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN an admin account already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of additional admin accounts
5. WHEN admin registration is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically log in the admin user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to log out of the application, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL remove the JWT token from localStorage
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all user data from the global state
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a global authentication state management system, so that I can easily check user authentication status and roles throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL check for existing JWT tokens and restore user session
2. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the global state immediately
3. WHEN components need to access user information THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to user data and authentication status
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL automatically include the JWT token in request headers
5. IF an API request returns a 401 unauthorized error THEN the system SHALL automatically log out the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to conditionally render content based on my role, so that I only see features appropriate to my access level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display admin-specific navigation and features
2. WHEN a regular user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display user-appropriate content
3. WHEN a manager is logged in THEN the system SHALL display manager-appropriate content
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL only display public content and authentication forms
5. WHEN a user tries to access a route they don't have permission for THEN the system SHALL redirect them appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized HTTP client configuration, so that all API requests are handled consistently with proper authentication headers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes API requests THEN the system SHALL use a configured axios instance
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL automatically include the Bearer token in all API requests
3. WHEN API requests fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling
4. WHEN the API returns validation errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN API responses are successful THEN the system SHALL handle the data appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation and user feedback, so that I understand what information is required and if there are any errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a form with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display validation error messages
2. WHEN a user enters invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an email validation error
3. WHEN a user enters a password shorter than 6 characters THEN the system SHALL display a password length error
4. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
5. WHEN API requests succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success or error messages
