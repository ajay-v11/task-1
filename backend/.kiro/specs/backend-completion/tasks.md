# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Implement Card Controller with role-based CRUD operations

  - Create complete card controller with getAllCards, createCard, updateCard, deleteCard, and getCardById methods
  - Implement role-based filtering logic for card access (Admin sees all, Manager sees all but edits own, User sees only assigned)
  - Add ownership validation for card editing operations
  - Include proper error handling and validation for all card operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 2. Implement User Controller for profile and user management

  - Create user controller with getAllUsers, getUserProfile, and getUserById methods
  - Implement role-based access control for user listing (Admin only)
  - Add profile endpoint accessible to all authenticated users
  - Include proper error handling and user data sanitization
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2_

- [ ] 3. Update Card Routes to use new controller methods

  - Replace placeholder route handlers with actual controller method calls
  - Ensure proper middleware chain (authenticate, authorize) for each endpoint
  - Add route parameter validation for card ID operations
  - Test route accessibility with different user roles
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Update User Routes to use new controller methods

  - Replace placeholder route handlers with actual controller method calls
  - Ensure proper role-based access control for user listing endpoints
  - Add route parameter validation for user ID operations
  - Test user profile access for authenticated users
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

  - Implement proper error responses for validation failures
  - Add not found handling for non-existent cards and users
  - Ensure database errors are handled gracefully with appropriate status codes
  - Add request validation middleware for card creation and updates
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Test all endpoints with different user roles
  - Create test users with different roles (Admin, Manager, User)
  - Test card CRUD operations with each role to verify permissions
  - Test user management endpoints with appropriate role restrictions
  - Verify error responses and status codes for unauthorized operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
