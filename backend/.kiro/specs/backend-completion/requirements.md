2. WHEN an Admin edits any card THEN the system SHALL allow the modification regardless of who created it
3. WHEN an Admin views cards THEN the system SHALL return all cards in the system
4. WHEN an Admin creates a user/manager account THEN the system SHALL create the account and set the Admin as creator
5. WHEN an Admin lists users THEN the system SHALL return all users in the system

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a User, I want to view and edit only my assigned card, so that I can manage my personal tasks

### Requirement 4

3. WHEN a user requests another user's profile directly THEN the system SHALL only return their own profile

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain data integrity and proper error handling, so that the application is robust and secure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted for card creation THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with 400 status
